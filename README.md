## how it works

Inspired by [slick](https://github.com/ChrisPenner/slick) static site generator.

Uses the [shake build system](https://shakebuild.com/).
Renders markdown files into a static webpage and generates syndication feeds.

Reproducibly built using [nix](https://nixos.org/). And cached with [cachix](https://cachix.org/).

Automated CI deployment to Github Pages (using Github Action).
