# This blog : Origin

I've decide to start a blog.

After a short-lasting affair with Medium, this time for real and doing it proper.
And after the final bit of procrastination - building a custom static
site generator - I'm ready.

## Why and What

Two questions, one answer.

Blog is short for weblog. And that's my intention here. To keep a
public log of activities and ideas.

> The term "weblog" was coined by Jorn Barger on December 17, 1997.

The motivation behind this blog is entirely selfish.
I intent to:

1. Force myself to better formulate ideas and projects
2. Hold myself accountable
3. Keep a "paper" trail - for future reference and to share with others

That's about enough for the start.

## How

- Inspired by [slick](https://github.com/ChrisPenner/slick) static site generator.
- Uses the [shake build system](https://shakebuild.com/).
  Renders markdown files into a static webpage and generates syndication feeds.
- Reproducibly built using [nix](https://nixos.org/). And cached with [cachix](https://cachix.org/).
- Automated CI deployment to Github Pages (using Github Action).

TL;DR push and forget

## Conclusion

Finally started a blog. Github centric setup.
Do the same, if you like.
