# Hacktoberfest 2020

[The now infamous open-source "promotion" event.](https://drewdevault.com/2020/10/01/Spamtoberfest.html)

I made my first open source contribution on github because of this event.
It works, in a way - gets people to contribute.
That was 4 years ago.

## 2019

I've accidentally completed the [hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) last year, because of
pull-based development workflow we used at a closed-source (and would
not make much sense to be open source, as it was custom hardware,
bespoke made for a competition) project, which happened to be hosted on
github.

This together with merging some pull-requests on personal repos (they
were my PR's on my repos, too) made me accidentally complete the
hacktoberfest on the first day.

## 2020

Since then, I have first-hand observed some issues stemming from the
pull-based workflow and steered clear of it - towards trunk based
development (AKA rebase is your best friend) and made (almost) no more PRs.

I did not register for this year's hacktoberfest.

But I gained something much more valuable than a t-shirt - linear git history.

Perhaps the real t-shirt was the friends we made along the way.
