    <h1>A-FRAME - some forking required</h1>
<p>About building a VR photo album as this years' &quot;expo&quot;.
Here is the final result:</p>
<p><a href="https://expo.trestripes.com/2020/index.html">trestripes 2020 expo</a></p>
<p>This was built using the industry-standard, and the only full-fledged
solution to VR and AR website experiences - <a href="https://aframe.io/">&quot;A-FRAME&quot;</a>.
Here follows the very incomplete documentation of the whole process, and
some observations.</p>
<h2>Extensibility</h2>
<p>A-frame is a rather thin wrapper around THREE.js and the DOM. It does
not try to provide solutions to every use-case ever. But offers good
defaults and provides a standard way of extending it - writing custom
components.</p>
<p>Sounds great, but.
For this relatively small website, I had to create 2 custom components.
One for the layout and one for fitting geometry to the texture size.</p>
<p>These components were not custom, just customized - but still had to
fork the whole code.</p>
<h3>OO vs f</h3>
<p>This exposes the biggest issue with objects - they are entities of their
own. Encapsulating a certain behavior or workflow instead of an
operation, which could be rewired in a different way.</p>
<p>Because of needing to change a single line in the
<code>fit-texture-component</code> I will be stuck with maintaining the fork of
this component.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When extensibility is a priority, objects are not an option.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Complex and Complicated</h3>
<p>Here is a nice overview of addressing innate complexity by Alan Kay.</p>
<p><div class='video-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ubaX1Smg6pY'></iframe></div></p>
<p>The overall idea of the talk is - even though some tasks are inherently
complex, we can split them into simpler atomic pieces and address them
one by one.</p>
<p>If we are able to solve the atomic pieces completely, such that the
complexity does not leak into other parts depending on this one, we have
successfully simplified the problem.</p>
